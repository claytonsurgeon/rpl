only variable free graphs should be full expanded, because they will reduce down to constant values during compilation


or should everything be expanded?
unlike RPL does not actually call any external functions, it only provides signals to initiate execution

if everything is completely expanded, then external sources won't actually be duplicated, just 

what about large variable graphs of calculations that could otherwise be done once?
