an input is a static memory location that can be written too
a signal triggers a re-evaluation
a variable is combination of an input and a signal

clock is a signal that cycles between 1 and 0 at a specified rate
time is a an input that contains some date/time information

by combining a clock signal and a time input, you can have a variable that returns the current number of seconds, updated every second

the signal is bidirection, meaning that the time should accept a clock signal so it knows how often to poll for new data
that same signal should be used by the consumer of the time data to initiate re-evaluation




flags and time




it would be better to treat signals as a type of number, because clocks should be regular. Complex signals can be made by 'OR'ing simple signals together
